# Diesel Exhaust Gas Treatment Solution
On Jan. 1, 2010, tough new EPA emissions regulations required all new diesel engines to reduce nitrogen dioxide emission levels by 90 percent from 2007 and by 96 percent from 1994.

# Which vehicle require DEF
The 2011 Ford F-Series Super Duty, powered by the all-new 6.7-liter Power Stroke V-8, and the 2011 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra HD pickups, powered by the updated 6.6-liter LML Duramax V-8. Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks use a urea-free NOx absorber catalyst that doesn’t require DEF, while Ram 3500, 4500 and 5500 chassis trucks use urea SCR and DEF.

Because diesel trucks that run out of DEF are no longer emissions-compliant, they are virtually immobilized when the DEF tank runs dry, even if there’s diesel fuel available to keep them trucking. Ford, GM and Chrysler have similar strategies to alert drivers when their DEF tanks have 1,000 miles or less range left, so modern diesel drivers won’t get stranded on the side of the road.

### Understanding How BlueTEC engines Work
https://www.mb-kc.com/mercedes-benz-bluetec-engines
Mercedes-Benz didn’t stumble upon the world’s cleanest diesel vehicle by chance. It took years of engineering and innovation to get them where they are today. Modern Mercedes-Benz BlueTEC engines work as well-oiled machines, using complex components like high-pressure fuel injection and variable-vane turbo to create more powerful combustion, which is where the incredible low-end torque originates.

A substance called AdBlue helps Mercedes-Benz BlueTEC engines produce such clean emissions. When AdBlue is injected into the the exhaust, the substance converts nitrogen oxide emissions into harmless nitrogen and oxygen, emitting very little detrimenal gas.

### What are Selective Catalytic Reduction and urea injection?

Diesel fuel is carbon rich and close in composition to home heating oil. As such, it’s inherently dirty and sooty when burned. While heavy-duty diesel pickups, vans, trucks, and other commercial vehicles follow looser environmental standards, light-duty vehicles have it tough—and nowhere is it tougher to certify a diesel car or truck than in the U.S. In order to trap particulates and curb nitrogen oxide in practically all new diesel engines, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and urea injection must be used.

A three-way catalytic converter in gasoline vehicles treats exhaust gas by both oxidizing (adding oxygen to convert carbon monoxide and other hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water) and reducing (removing oxygen to convert nitrogen oxide to nitrogen and water). But diesel engines burn so lean that they require separate oxidation and reduction catalysts. After diesel exhaust passes through the oxidation catalyst and a particulate filter, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF, branded by VW as AdBlue) is injected into the stream before entering the reduction catalyst. DEF is a precise mixture of one-third urea and two-thirds deionized water and must be refilled (typically at manufacturer-recommended oil-change intervals) from a separate tank.

# Problems with: Diesel Exhaust Gas Treatment System

The Selective Catalytic Reduction(SCR) technology that uses a urea based diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and a catalytic converter to significantly reduce oxides of nitrogen(NOx) emissions. SCR is the leading technology being used to meet 2010 emission regulations. The system comprase with A Urea Tank(group 1), a Urea heating barrel(group 5), a DEF pump(group 9), tubing and Urea injector(group 17). The only moving part is the DEF pump that injects small quantities (2% of the diesel fuel) of DEF into the exhaust upstream of a catalyst. The DEF vaporizes and decomposes to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia (NH3) is the desired product which in conjunction to the SCR catalyst, converts the NOx to harmless nitrogen(N2) and water(H2O).

A 32.5% solution of DEF will begin to crystallize and freeze at 12 deg F (-11 deg C). At 32.5%, both the urea and water will freeze at the same rate, ensuring that as it thaws, the fluid does not become diluted, or over concentrated. The freezing and unthawing of DEF will not cause degradation of the product. DEF expands by approximately 7% when frozen. DEF packaging and tanks are designed to allow for expansion.

During vehicle operation, SCR systems are designed to provide heating for the DEF tank and supply lines. If DEF freezes when the vehicle is shut down, start up and normal operation of the vehicle will not be inhibited. The SCR heating system is designed to quickly return the DEF to liquid form and the operation of the vehicle will not be impacted. The freezing and unthawing of DEF will not cause degradation of the product. No additive could be use to improve the freeze point. Any further blending or adjusting of the DEF mixture will impede its ability to perform correctly and may cause damage to the SCR components.

The AdBlue tank is designed to store enough to make it to the next service but with aggressive driving it may have to be topped off before then. AdBlue’s freezing point is 12º Fahrenheit and unlike windshield washer fluid, there are no compatible anti-freezing additives. As a result, the entire storage and supply system is heated and there are no moving parts in the tank. Instead of a float to measure the level, an electronic sensor uses three switches to indicate Full, Reserve and Empty. There are three heaters as well — one in the tank, one inside the pump, and one on the pressure line to the metering valve. The pump is mounted on top of the tank but it has to pull from the bottom, so it has a hard time priming, unlike a fuel pump which is submerged. When the engine is shut off, the metering valve is held open, the pump switches into reverse, and empties the line so that it doesn’t freeze.

Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) is a blended aqueous urea solution of 32.5% high purity urea and 67.5% deionized water used to reduce pollution in newer Tier 4 Final diesel engines. As DEF is injected directly into your SCR system, quality control is critical for peak operation of your equipment.

Poor quality DEF can cause significant component damage, equipment failure and void the manufacturer’s warranty leading to expensive repair costs. When diesel exhaust fluid quality deteriorates, you may experience increased DEF consumption or reduced DEF effectiveness, equipment failure, SCR system malfunctions or component damage.

## Diesel Exhaust Fluid quality can be affected by:

Crystallization:  Crystallization can occur in a couple of ways – over-dosing and hard water top ups. Over-dosing occurs when too much DEF is added to the system – the DEF may not fully hydrolyze which can lead to crystalized deposits in the exhaust or injector nozzle. Over-dosing can result from a partially open DEF injector nozzle, plugged DEF lines or DEF pump issues. Topping up your DEF system with hard water can also result in scale or deposits forming.
Dirt / Metal Contamination: Contaminated DEF can cause abrasion of the DEF pump. Dirt, rust or tank scale can occur with improper of DEF storage or handling (e.g. res-using disposable DEF containers).
UREA Concentration (Dilution): Diluted DEF (too much water) reduces its NOx neutralization effectiveness. Most DEF is sold pre-mixed but topping up with water will affect concentrations (and could also lead to crystallization as noted above).
Cold Weather: DEF may gel or freeze in colder climates (12ºF (-11ºC)) preventing engine operation. Additives should not be used to thaw DEF as additives can throw off the concentration of the fluid and damage the SCR system. A electrical heating barrel is controlled by a thermalstat. Any malfunction of the control circle could affect the quality of the DEF. A freezing Urea tank will proventing the engine running. Or overheated Urea tank will cause the crystalliztion, Urea concentration and contamination problems eventually. 
Other Fluids: Contamination of the DEF tank from other fluids such as diesel fuel, coolant, or engine oil being added can cause damage to the SCR system and engine shutdown.
